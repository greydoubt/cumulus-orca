### Glacier Storage
[Amazon S3 Glacier](https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/) is a secure,
durable, and extremely low-cost [cloud storage service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html) 
for data archiving and long-term backup.
ORCA supports the [S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html) variant,
and these documents will use the terms interchangeably.
See [Storage Class documentation](../../operator/storage-classes.md) for more details.

### Granule
A granule is the smallest aggregation of data that can be independently
managed (described, inventoried, and retrieved). Granules are always
associated with a collection, which is a grouping of granules. A granule is
a grouping of data files.
