title: Deploying Documentation
desc: Provides basic information on deploying ORCA documentation to nasa.github.io
---

The following sections provide information to ORCA users to create automated or
manual releases on github. View the entire versioning and releases document
[here](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus-orca/blob/master/docs/release.md).

## Automated Documentation Release on Github

The release is automated in Bamboo, but the step must be manually started. If
you set the `RELEASE_FLAG` to `true` and the build steps passed, you will be
able to run the manual "Release" step in Bamboo.

On a successful automated release, the updated documentation is committed to
the `gh-pages` branch of the [Cumulus ORCA repo](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus-orca).
The updated documentation should be available on the [Cumulus ORCA website](https://nasa.github.io/cumulus-orca).

## Manual Documentation Release on Github

Use the following steps to update Github documentation manually. Additional
deployment information can be found at the [Docusaurus deployment page](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment).

:::important Important

* Users need the latest LTS Node version installed to perform manual updates to documentation.
* The `Deployment_Branch` must = **gh-pages**.
:::

1. Clone the Cumulus ORCA repo to your machine. Enter the repo directory and
   change to the proper branch.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nasa/cumulus-orca.git
   cd cumulus-orca
   git checkout release-X.Y.Z
   ```

2. Enter the `website` directory

   ```sh
   cd website
   ```

3. Export the needed environment variables. Make sure to use your GitHub
   username and password.

   ```sh
   export DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH=gh-pages
   export GIT_USER=$bamboo_SECRET_GITHUB_USER
   export GIT_PASS=$bamboo_SECRET_GITHUB_TOKEN
   ```

4. If your user email and username configuration is not set for git, that must
   be done before running the deploy in order to avoid errors when pushing to
   the GitHub repository. If the config is set, this step can be skipped.

   ```sh
   git config --global user.email "$bamboo_SECRET_GITHUB_EMAIL"
   git config --global user.name "$GIT_USER"
   ```

5. Run the deployment script via npm.

   ```sh
   npm run deploy
   ```
