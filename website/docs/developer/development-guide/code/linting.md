[Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) is a best-practice analysis 
tool that is used to flag coding errors, including, but not 
limited to, false-positives, syntax errors, and style errors 
in Python. Pylint follows the style recommended by the 
[Python style guide or PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
